# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests

This notebook applies tree-based classification algorithms to predict heart disease.

## Whatâ€™s Included
- Trained a Decision Tree and visualized it
- Controlled overfitting by limiting tree depth
- Trained and evaluated a Random Forest model
- Compared both models' accuracy
- Visualized feature importances
- Used cross-validation for model evaluation

## Dataset
- [Heart Disease Dataset (CSV)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

## Tools Used
- Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier)
