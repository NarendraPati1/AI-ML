# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Iris Dataset Classification

This notebook implements the KNN classification algorithm using the famous Iris dataset to classify flower species.

---

## Objective
- Understand how the KNN algorithm works.
- Implement it using scikit-learn.
- Experiment with different values of `K`.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Visualize decision boundaries (2D).

---

## Dataset Used
- **Dataset**: [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)
- **Target**: Flower species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*

---

## Tasks Completed
- Loaded and normalized dataset.
- Split into training and testing sets.
- Trained KNN classifier with different values of K (1–10).
- Selected the best K based on accuracy.
- Plotted accuracy vs K.
- Displayed the confusion matrix.
- Visualized decision boundaries using the first 2 features.

---

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn` (`KNeighborsClassifier`, `StandardScaler`, `ConfusionMatrixDisplay`)

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Visual decision boundaries

---


## ✅ Output
