# üîç Task 4  
## Logistic Regression for Breast Cancer Classification

In this task, I built a binary classification model using **Logistic Regression** to predict breast cancer diagnoses from clinical data.

### ‚úÖ Key Steps:
- Imported the **Breast Cancer dataset** using `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`
- Preprocessed features with **StandardScaler** for normalization
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model for classification

### üìä Model Evaluation:
- Computed and visualized the **Confusion Matrix**
- Calculated **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**
- Plotted the **ROC Curve** and evaluated **AUC Score**
- Explored and visualized the **Sigmoid Activation Function**

### üß∞ Libraries Used:
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling  
- `scikit-learn` for modeling and evaluation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization

This task helped strengthen my understanding of logistic regression and model evaluation metrics in binary classification problems
