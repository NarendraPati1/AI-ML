# 🏡 AML_Task3: House Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This notebook focuses on applying **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** techniques to a housing dataset in order to predict house prices.

---

## 📦 Dataset
- **Source**: Housing Dataset  
- Contains features relevant to property characteristics and their corresponding prices.

---

## ✅ Tasks Performed

1. **Data Import & Basic Exploration**
   - Loaded dataset using `pandas`
   - Inspected structure, data types, and summary statistics

2. **Feature Selection & Target Setup**
   - Identified key independent variables (features)
   - Defined the dependent variable (house price)

3. **Train-Test Split**
   - Divided data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`

4. **Model Training**
   - Implemented **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated models using:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - R² Score

6. **Result Visualization**
   - Plotted Actual vs Predicted values using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
